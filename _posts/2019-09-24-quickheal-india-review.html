<h2>Why Quickheal ?</h2>
<p>I am using quickheal pro antivirus from last 3 years, there is no known virus that quickheal cannot detect. Once in my office, i forward up my pen drive to the staff member and asked him to send me some important files. Before transferring from his PC to pendrive, he thaught he should check the files before transferring. He opened the files and he got 400v shock, that files was currupted by virus which was more that a virus. He was very much scared, lost all his hope about promotion, but started thinking about future of his current job. He told me all story with a scary mind, and then i told him not worry and to find solution for that situation. I asked him to transfer the files along with the viruses and duplicates of the files which were created by the virus. Hopefully he transferred everything he got in that folder, and handed me that pen drive with a guilty face. I ask him to follow me to my cabin and he sat beside me all his eyes on my screen hoping he'd not have done my work bad. I inserted my pen drive, popup came that "PenDrive has been detected", within seconds, quickheal started his job to scanning as always it does. I had no expections from quickheal to detect as strong virus as i never saw in my life. As soon as its scanning reach 24%, it started showing my database list with virses one by one. I and He was literally shock after seeing the last total digit of viruses. That files were total 32 and duplicates created by virus was about 102 with all of them were literallu >200kb's of size. I saw the total virus digits which were 12 almost trojans and malwares, not only viruses. And after that quick heal said he has fixed all file. Fixed ! Really ? I was shocked to see that message, i opened one of that file with the name of My Lord Shri Ram, and boom the file opened seamlessly, just like butter on bread.</p>
<p>After this incident, Quick Heal became my second love, fist one is Riya, everyone knows. I want to thanks my cousin Meher Lonkar for suggesting me this awesome invention by quick heal team. In todays internet world i cannot suggest you an antivirus more better than quickheal, it saved my work, and it will help your work too.</p>
