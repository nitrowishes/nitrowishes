<h2>Why Antivirus today ?</h2>

<h2>Quickheal antivirus and its advantages ?</h2>
<p>I am using quickheal pro antivirus from last 3 years, there is no known virus that quickheal cannot detect. Once in my office, i forward up my pen drive to one of my staff member Suresh and asked him to send me some important files. Before transferring from his PC to pendrive, he thought he should check the files before transferring. He opened the files and got a 440volt shock feeling, the files were currupted by malwares and trojans. He was very much scared, lost all his hope about promotion, but started thinking about future of his current job. He told me all story with a guilty mindset, and then i told him not worry and to find solution for that situation. I asked him to transfer all the files along with the viruses and duplicates of the files which were created by the virus. Hopefully he transferred everything he got in that folder, and handed me that pen drive with a guilty face. I ask him to follow me to my cabin and he sat beside me all his eyes on my screen hoping he'd not have done my work bad. I inserted my pen drive, popup came that "PenDrive has been detected", within seconds, quickheal started his job to scanning as always it does. I had no expections from quickheal to detect as strong virus as i never saw in my life. As soon as its scanning reach 24%, it started showing my database list with virses one by one. I and He was literally shocked after seeing the total number of viruses. That important files were total 32, duplicate files created by virus were about 102 with all of them were literally >200kb's of size. I saw the total number viruses which were 12 and almost trojans and malwares. After that quick heal beeped and notified me that it has fixed all files and viruses. Fixed ! Really ? I was shocked after reading that message, i opened one of that file with the name of My Lord Shri Ram, and boom the file opened seamlessly, just like butter on bread.</p>
<p>After this incident, Quick Heal became my second love. I want to thanks my cousin Meher Lonkar for suggesting me this awesome invention by quick heal team. In todays internet world i really feel greatful to suggest you quickheal, it had saved my work, and it will protect your pc and your privacy too.</p>
