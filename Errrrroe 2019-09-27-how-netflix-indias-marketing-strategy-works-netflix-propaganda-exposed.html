Who don’t love watching movies and TV-series, everyone loves. But behind all of us, some extra-talented guys tries advanced tactics to get some extra fame and promotion. Today we’ll find out their amazing tricks of surviving in India, even with poisonous ideologies.

Whenever we say TV-series, the first word came in our mind is Netflix. Netflix is a OTT platform founded by Mr. Reed Hastings, Mr. Marc Randolph with almost revenue of 15.794 Billion US dollars in only 2018 and over 154 million user base from all over the world.

Netflix started to work and collaborate with India in January 2016. They also came here to generate some extra revenue by doing investments and shares. They were doing it great and Indians were also supporting them, because Indians always respects everyone as we were always taught by our parents and society that everyone who come to us is our guest and “Atithi Devo Bhavah”, means guest must be treated as god. We always believe in our teachings like “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” which meaning is ‘The whole World is a family’. But can you imagine, what happens if people takes our holy teachings as a weapon and try to hit us back ? This our today’s topic, how a multinational company uses cheap marketing strategies to fulfill their toxic ideologies.

Netflix India started its first series with toxic left-liberal ideology on 6th July of 2018. Mainstream media was very very exited about this series because of his propaganda and pseudo-liberal ideology, debates were started about this series, lots of hashtags such as Ban Netflix, Boycott Netflix were trending. People thought, Wow, now we have done it right. But people don't understand the mindset behind all of these series. Netflix used this negative exposure in a positive and evil mindset, they ran reverse technique here. How ? Lets go !

We shall go here with an example, Suppose Netflix released a neutral web series, neither left nor right, they have done promotion, advertising, poster advertising and anything they could do so.
After advertising, 1 million people get to know that, Yes, Netflix has released something and we should watch it. 40% to 50% of them will watch it, enjoy it, review it by their mindset and personal opinions. But, what if they add left ideology, bashing specific religion which is more than 50% of specific country ( Majority ), showing them in bad and negative way. They'll do noise. This is what they want, they want us to make noise, spam their content like “See, this Bla-Bla series had hurt my sentiments, disrespected my Religion” and we let others enjoy drama between us and Netflix. TV debates running, hashtags with actual names of series running trending on Twitter, Facebook is full of posts such as Boycott this series, ban this app, but after all this you'll see after some months, again a new series of this type.

This is because of our noise, our noise is very powerful, we know, but we have to agree that, making noise on twitter and other platforms is just the promotion of them. Remember I told you that, neutral series will get 1 million user interaction, but can you imagine what is happening when you post their content names on social media. Their attention got double, they'll got double interaction after your boycotts. So now you'll be wondering, then what we have to do against these ?
We have to be silent, analyze the content, and silently block all transactions and trades with these platforms. Yes, its only the way we can stop them, by making noise on their names, we are just promoting them. We have to make their roots weak, that is the funds they are getting. Ask your each and every family member, friends, coworkers if they are using these applications, convince them to stop subscribing these type of services, share information with them, share the black sides of these platforms with them, without any noise. Silence is important, we cannot do anything by attacking them on social media, we are just helping them to earn more and more revenue and come back to us more stronger than previous.
